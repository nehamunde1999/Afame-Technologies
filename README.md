# Afame Technologies: Data Analysis and Prediction Projects

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for three data analysis and prediction projects:

1. **HR Data Analysis**: Analyzing employee data to gain insights into various HR-related aspects such as attrition rates, employee demographics, job satisfaction, performance, salary, compensation, tenure, career progression, and work-life balance.

2. **Titanic Survival Prediction**: Predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, embarkation port, family size, etc. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

3. **Sales Data Analysis**: Analyzing sales data from an e-commerce platform to understand sales trends, identify best-selling products, analyze revenue indicators, and perform other relevant analyses.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nehamunde1999/Afame-Technologies.git
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Navigate to the respective project folder (HR Data Analysis, Titanic Survival Prediction, or Sales Data Analysis) and run the Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis and predictions.**
